        An interview with Mule Designâ€™s Erika Hall about philosophy, phone calls and her professional journey.

        <em>
          In the fall of 2013 I interviewed Erika Hall, co-founder of <a href="http://muledesign.com/"> Mule Design Studio</a>, one of the most influential design practices in North America. It was the first of fourteen interviews that I would conduct for my book <a href="http://howtheygotthere.com/"> How They Got There: Interviews With Digital Designers About Their Careers</a>, and so in many ways it was the most important, too.

          I knew that, if it went off well, our discussion would serve as a kind of template for the others that would follow, and so I was relieved when Erika talked about her professional life with such unaffected candor and incisive wit. Her tales of the first dot-com bubble and burst, and how she salvaged from that wreckage the building blocks that would lead to Mule Design, were exactly what I was looking for. This interview remains one of my very favorites from all of the ones I conducted for How They Got There.
